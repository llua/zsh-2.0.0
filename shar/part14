X.RE
X.PP
XUnless preceded by a

Xthe modification is applied only to the

X.IR l ;
Xan error results if no string matches.
X.PP
XThe left-hand side of substitutions are not regular expressions,
Xbut character strings.
XAny character can be used as the delimiter in place of
X.BR / .
XA backslash quotes the delimiter character.
XThe character
X.BR & ,

Xfrom the left-hand-side. 
XThe
X.B &

XA null
X.I l

XNamed parameters can be referenced by name within an arithmetic expression
Xwithout using the parameter substitution syntax.

XArithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each
Xassignment to a named parameter declared integer
Xin this manner.
X.PP
XSince many of the arithmetic operators require
Xquoting, an alternative form of the
X.B let
Xcommand is provided.
XFor any command which begins with a
X.BR (( ,
Xall the characters until a matching
X.B ))
Xare treated as a quoted expression.

X.SH PARAMETERS
XA parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
XA name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
Xcharacters and _'s, or the single characters
X*, @, #, ?, \-, $, or !.
XThe value may be either a \fIscalar\fP (a string),
Xan integer, or an array.
XTo assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter,
Xuse the \fBtypeset\fP builtin.
XTo assign an array value, use \fBset \-A\fP \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP ....
XThe value of a parameter may also be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP ...
X.RE
X.PP
XIf the integer attribute, \-\fBi\fP, is set for \fIname\fP,
Xthe \fIvalue\fP is subject to arithmetic evaluation.
X.PP
XThe value of an array parameter may be assigned by writing:
X.RS
X.PP
X\fIname\fP=(\fIvalue\fP ...) ...
X.RE
XIndividual elements of an array may be selected using a 
Xsubscript.  A subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp\fB]\fR
Xselects the single element \fIexp\fP, where \fIexp\fP is
Xan arithmetic expression.
XA subscript of the form \fB[*]\fP evaluates to all
Xelements of an array.
XA subscript of the form \fB[\fIexp1\fP,\fIexp2\fB]\fR
Xselects all elements in the range \fIexp1\fP to \fIexp2\fP,
Xinclusive.
XIf \fIexp2\fP evaluates to \-1, then all elements from
X\fIexp1\fP to the end of the array are extracted.
X.PP
XSubscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
Xcase the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.
XFor example, if \fBFOO\fP is set to \fBfoobar\fP, then
X\fBecho $FOO[2,5]\fP prints \fBooba\fP.
X.SS Positional Parameters
XPositional parameters are set by the shell on invocation,
Xby the \fBset\fP builtin, or by direct assignment.
XThe parameter \fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is a number,
Xis the \fIn\fPth positional parameter.
XThe parameters \fB*\fP, \fB@\fP, and \fBargc\fP are
Xarrays containing all the positional parameters;
Xthus \fBargc\fP[\fIn\fP], etc. is equivalent to simply \fIn\fP.

X.TP
X.B BAUD
XThe baud rate of the current connection.  Used by the line editor
Xupdate mechanism to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying
Xupdates until necessary.  This may be profitably set to a lower value
Xin some circumstances, e.g.
Xfor slow modems dialing into a communications server which is connected
Xto a host via a fast link; in this case, this variable
Xwould be set by default to the speed of the fast link, and not
Xthe modem.
XThis parameter should be set to the baud
Xrate of the slowest part of the link for best performance.

Xof the mail file.
XThe default message is "You have new mail."
X.TP
X.B path (PATH)
XAn array (colon-separated list)
Xof directories to search for commands.
XWhen this parameter is set, each directory is scanned
Xand all files found are put in a hash table.
XIf a component of \fBpath\fP begins with the string "\fB/.\fP",
