zsh is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.

To get this shell running, cd into the src directory and type
"buildzsh".  I tested it on the following machines, where it compiled
just by running this script:

Sun SPARCServer 4/490 running SunOS 4.1.1
Sun 3/60C running SunOS 4.1.1
Sun 4-something running SunOS 4.0.3
NeXTstation running Mach 2.0
SGI-4D/25 running IRIX 3.3.1
hp9000 running a variant of BSD4.3

If it doesn't work, either complain to me, or tweak config.h, Makefile, and
signals.h until it does.

Tabstops are 3 spaces.  If you're going to look at my code, run it
though "expand -3" first, or set your tab stops to the same as mine.

If anyone has any questions, suggestions, comments, bugs, flames, or
any other mail of any kind, send it to pfalstad@phoenix.princeton.edu.
I did not supply any patches or bug fixes for version 1, because I junked
most of it as soon as I released it.  This version will be more permanent,
hopefully, so I'll be able to fix bugs quickly as soon as they're found.

Thanks to the following people for help, ideas, comments, patches, etc.:
